    "# Webscraping\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is Web Scraping?\n",
    "Web scraping is the process of automatically extracting data from websites. When you visit a website, your browser sends an HTTP request to a server, which responds with HTML code that your browser renders as a webpage.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Do We Need Headers?\n",
    "When you visit a website normally, your browser sends information about itself (called headers) to the web server. This includes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **User-Agent**: Identifies what browser you're using (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)\n",
    "- **Accept**: What types of content your browser can handle\n",
    "- **Accept-Language**: Your preferred languages\n",
    "- **Accept-Encoding**: What compression methods you support\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Problem:\n",
    "Many websites block requests that don't look like they come from a real browser. A basic Python request without headers might look like a bot or scraper, causing the server to:\n",
    "- Block the request entirely\n",
    "- Return different (often minimal) content\n",
    "- Redirect to a \"bot detection\" page\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Solution:\n",
    "We include headers that make our request look like it's coming from a real web browser, specifically Google Chrome on Windows 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "### HTML Tags We'll Encounter:\n",
    "- **`<p>`**: Paragraph tags - contain main text content\n",
    "- **`<h1>`, `<h2>`, etc.**: Heading tags - titles and section headers\n",
    "- **`<div>`**: Division tags - containers that often hold content blocks\n",
    "- **`<article>`**: Article tags - main content areas\n",
    "- **`<script>`**: JavaScript code - we remove this as it's not readable text\n",
    "- **`<style>`**: CSS styling - we remove this as it's not content\n",
    "- **`<a>`**: Links - may contain text but often just navigation\n",
    "- **`<span>`**: Inline containers - sometimes contain text snippets\n",
    "\n",
    "### robots.txt and Ethics:\n",
    "Always check a website's robots.txt file (e.g., website.com/robots.txt) to see their scraping policy. Respect rate limits and terms of service!"

    "5. **Whitespace normalization**: Ensures consistent spacing between words\n",
    "\n",
    "### Regular Expressions Explained:\n",
    "- `r'http[s]?://...'`: Matches web URLs starting with http:// or https://\n",

    "### What is Lemmatization?\n",
    "Lemmatization reduces words to their base or dictionary form (lemma) while preserving meaning:\n",
    "- **running, runs, ran** → **run**\n",
    "- **better, best** → **good**\n",
    "- **children** → **child**\n",
    "- **mice** → **mouse**\n",
    "\n",
    "### Lemmatization vs Stemming:\n",
    "- **Stemming**: Crude chopping of word endings (running → runn, flies → fli)\n",
    "- **Lemmatization**: Uses vocabulary and morphological analysis (running → run, flies → fly)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Use Lemmatization?\n",
    "1. **Reduces vocabulary size**: Treats related words as the same concept\n",
    "2. **Improves analysis**: \"invest\", \"investing\", \"investment\" become related\n",
    "3. **Better for readability**: Output words are real dictionary words\n",
    "4. **Semantic preservation**: Maintains the actual meaning of words\n",
    "\n",

    "# BERTopic Modeling for Unsupervised Topic Discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is BERTopic?\n",
    "BERTopic is a modern topic modeling technique that leverages transformer models (like BERT) and clustering to find topics in text. It's powerful because it understands the context of words, unlike older methods like LDA.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How it Works:\n",
    "1. **Embeddings**: It converts documents into numerical representations (embeddings) that capture semantic meaning.\n",
    "2. **Clustering**: It groups similar documents together using clustering algorithms. These clusters form our topics.\n",
    "3. **Topic Representation**: It identifies the most representative words for each topic cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Advantages:\n",
    "- **Context-Aware**: Understands that \"bank\" can mean a financial institution or a river bank based on context.\n",
    "- **No Pre-defined Number of Topics**: It automatically determines the optimal number of topics.\n",
    "- **Rich Visualizations**: Provides excellent tools for exploring and understanding the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Note:\n",
    "BERTopic works best on a collection of documents (like paragraphs or articles). For this analysis, we will treat each scraped paragraph as a separate document."
